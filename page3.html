        <h2>GPU - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 TI</h2>
        <p>The heart of my gaming rig is the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 TI GPU. With decent performance, it handles demanding games and rendering tasks with ease. The reason why I choose the 4060 TI is because of its price relative to other GPU's at the time, costing about 350$ which was within my budget. </p>

        <h2>CPU - Intel Core i7-13700K (13th Gen)</h2>
        <p>The 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13700K was another choice for me when it came to finding a CPU within my budget. With 16 cores and 24 threads, it delivers great performance for gaming. While doing good on multitasking or running intensive applications, this CPU handles everything with relative ease.</p>

        <h2>Total Cost</h2>
        <p>The total cost of my build came to approximately $1200 for all its parts. This includes the GPU, CPU, motherboard, RAM, storage, and all the other essentials besides my mouse and keyboard which I already had. It was a big investment, but the performance and satisfaction I had after putting it all together was absolutely worth it!</p>
