        <h2 class="game-title">Marvel Rivals</h2> <!-- Added a class for styling -->
        <p>One of my favorite games currently is Marvel Rivals. I love highly competitive games where I feel awarded for outplaying my enemies by either mechanical skill or by simply knowing the game better then my opponent. I also just like using the characters I see in Marvel movies and can imagine myself doing those exact things in this game.</p>

        <h2 class="game-title">Valorant</h2> <!-- Added a class for styling -->
        <p>Another favorite of mine is Valorant. The tactical gameplay and team coordination was something that encapsulated me when I first got into the game. I played the game so much that I eventually got into the top 0.17% of players in the game!</p>
